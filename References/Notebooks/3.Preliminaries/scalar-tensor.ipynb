    "Now that you can store and manipulate data,\n",

    "that you will need to understand and implement\n",
    "most of models covered in this book.\n",

    "If you never studied linear algebra or machine learning,\n",
    "then your past experience with math probably consisted\n",
    "of thinking about one number at a time.\n",
    "And, if you ever balanced a checkbook\n",
    "or even paid for dinner at a restaurant\n",
    "then you already know how to do basic things\n",
    "like adding and multiplying pairs of numbers.\n",
    "For example, the temperature in Palo Alto is $52$ degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "Formally, we call values consisting\n",
    "of just one numerical quantity *scalars*.\n",
    "If you wanted to convert this value to Celsius\n",
    "(the metric system's more sensible temperature scale),\n",
    "you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f$ to $52$.\n",
    "In this equation, each of the terms---$5$, $9$, and $32$---are scalar values.\n",
    "The placeholders $c$ and $f$ are called *variables*\n",
    "and they represented unknown scalar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we adopt the mathematical notation\n",
    "where scalar variables are denoted\n",
    "by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, and $z$).\n",
    "We denote the space of all (continuous) *real-valued* scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "For expedience, we will punt on rigorous definitions\n",
    "of what precisely *space* is,\n",
    "but just remember for now that the expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar.\n",
    "The symbol $\\in$ can be pronounced \"in\"\n",
    "and simply denotes membership in a set.\n",
    "Analogously, we could write $x,y \\in \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "to state that $x$ and $y$ are numbers\n",
    "whose value can only be $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MXNet code, a scalar is represented by an `ndarray` with just one element.\n",
    "In the next snippet, we instantiate two scalars\n",
